What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I was mostly confusing on making new branches and merging them at the end. I wasn't sure whether I should make a new branch every time I completed an assignment or just work on a branch outside of master. I wasn't sure if I should delete the branch after I merged them.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
git pull vs. git fetch + git merge
I was a little confused why we used git fetch and git merge when earlier on we were told to use git pull. It turns out that they pretty much do the same thing. git fetch and git merge just seperates the steps (one fetches the code and the other combines everything), whereas git pull just does everything at once.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I asked about how often we should create new branches and whether we should merged them every time. I also asked about merging conflicts and we should resolved them. 

The answers I got: get into the habit of creating branches often so you have good snapshots of your code. Also, after doing Release 5, I got a better understanding of how to resolve merging conflicts!

What still confuses you about Git?
As of right now, not a lot. I just think I need to work with it more often. If I come up with anything, I will make sure to ask!

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was great! Although a little nerve-racking at first, I really really enjoyed it! It's always kind of weird having a person watch over your shoulder when you are doing something, especially when you are doing something new. I love that we get feedback and that there is someone there when we need help. I am very excited for the next one! :)
