# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a way to manage files (documents, programs, etc.). Version control is useful because it allows people to see changes that are made to the files.  It also allows people to combine revisions made by different people.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
Branches exist in repositories. I compare it to "saving" a file. The master branch is the default branch. I would use a branch to create and edit/add to files and save it to a different branch. It is easy to move around branches and work on them. I can also combine or merge changes back into the original project. The changes are also tracked (which is super awesome)!

I love big butts and I cannot lie. 

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Got commit issues? NO NEED TO FEAR!
A commit is saving the file to the repository. It saves the changes made to the file, called a save point. 
A good commit message contains specific details about that progress of the file or the changes that have been made. 

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when you have trouble merging branches in your repository. There's usually an error message, saying something like "Conflict!"
