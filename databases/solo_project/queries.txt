1. Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
sqlite> .mode column
sqlite> .header on
sqlite> SELECT * FROM songs;
id          title           artist       year        early2000   genre_id  
----------  --------------  -----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
1           Knock You Down  Keri Hilson  2009        false       1

2. Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> UPDATE songs SET early2000="false"  WHERE id=6;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM songs;
id          title           artist       year        early2000   genre_id  
----------  --------------  -----------  ----------  ----------  ----------

5           Southside       Lloyd        2004        true        1         
6           Best I Ever Ha  Drake        2009        false       1

8           Ms. Jackson     OutKast      2000        true        2    



3. Display the information in both tables using one query.
sqlite> SELECT * FROM songs, genre WHERE songs.genre_id = genre.id;
id          title           artist       year        early2000   genre_id    id          type      
----------  --------------  -----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
1           Knock You Down  Keri Hilson  2009        false       1           1           love song 
2           Buy U A Drank   T Pain       2007        false       2           2           other     
3           Always On Time  Ja Rule      2001        true        1           1           love song 
4           Can't Let You   Fabolous     2003        true        1           1           love song 
5           Southside       Lloyd        2004        true        1           1           love song

7           The New Workou  Kanye West   2004        true        2           2           other     
8           Ms. Jackson     OutKast      2000        true        2           2           other    

 

4. Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.
sqlite> SELECT songs.title, songs.year, genre.type FROM songs JOIN genre ON songs.genre_id = genre.id;
title           year        type      
--------------  ----------  ----------
Knock You Down  2009        love song 
Buy U A Drank   2007        other     
Always On Time  2001        love song 
Can't Let You   2003        love song 
Southside       2004        love song 
Best I Ever Ha  2009        love song 
The New Workou  2004        other     
Ms. Jackson     2000        other   



5. Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
sqlite> DELETE FROM songs WHERE id=5;
sqlite> SELECT * FROM songs;
id          title           artist       year        early2000   genre_id  
----------  --------------  -----------  ----------  ----------  ----------
1           Knock You Down  Keri Hilson  2009        false       1         
2           Buy U A Drank   T Pain       2007        false       2         
3           Always On Time  Ja Rule      2001        true        1         
4           Can't Let You   Fabolous     2003        true        1         
6           Best I Ever Ha  Drake        2009        false       1         
7           The New Workou  Kanye West   2004        true        2         
8           Ms. Jackson     OutKast      2000        true        2     


RELEASE 3 
1. There are lots of different kinds of joins. What are they? Can you apply different conditions to a join to change what's displayed? Can you bookmark any good diagrams that will help you tell different joins apart in the future?
- natural join: naturally join by common columns. (i.e. same name) natural join can be inner join, a left outer join, or a right outer join.
- inner join: require at least a match when comparing two tables
- left join: returns all rows from the first(left) with the matching rows in the second(right) table, result in null if no match
- right join: returns all rows from the second(right) table, and the matched rows from the first(left) table
- full join: returns all rows when there is a match in one of the tables
